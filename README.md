## Send Rust logs to Logcat

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/android_logger.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/android_logger)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nercury/android_logger-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nercury/android_logger-rs)

This library is a drop-in replacement for `env_logger`. Instead, it outputs messages to
android's logcat.

This only works on Android and requires linking to `log` which
is only available under android. With Cargo, it is possible to conditionally require
this library:

```toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
android_logger = "0.5"
```

Example of initialization on activity creation:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate log;
extern crate android_logger;

use log::LogLevel;

fn native_activity_create() {
    android_logger::init_once(LogLevel::Trace); // trace == verbose

    trace!("this is a verbose {}", "message");
    error!("this is printed by default");
}
```

There is a caveat that this library can only be initialized once 
(hence the `init_once` function name). However, Android native activity can be
re-created every time the screen is rotated, resulting in multiple initialization calls.
Therefore this library will only log a warning for subsequent `init_once` calls.

This library ensures that logged messages do not overflow Android log message limits
by efficiently splitting messages into chunks.
